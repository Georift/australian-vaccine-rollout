# Australian Vaccine Rollout Data

At the moment the department of health [publishes](https://www.health.gov.au/initiatives-and-programs/covid-19-vaccines/australias-covid-19-vaccine-rollout#covid19-vaccine-rollout-daily-update) vaccination rollout data as a daily PDF which is a bit of a pain to work with.

While looking for a better source I came across this amazing article by the Digital Story Innovation Team at the ABC "[Tracking Australiaâ€™s COVID vaccine rollout numbers](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-03-02/charting-australias-covid-vaccine-rollout/13197518)". It appears as though someone at the ABC is collating all of this data and doing a great job of it.

The repo will scrape the API the article is using and store any change 3 times per hour. Hopefully I'm not ruffling any feathers by doing this, but I feel like this could be useful information to share.
